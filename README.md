## Project: Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction
Repository for submission of my capstone project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree through Udacity

This project is a recent Kaggle competition from RStudio, Google Cloud and Kaggle to demonstrate the impact that thorough data analysis can have. 
For many businesses the 80/20 rule has proven true, where only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. 
This challenges marketing teams to invest in the most appropriate promotional strategies and target the right customers to increase revenue. 
I will be employing a Deep Learning neural network here to attempt to solve the problem through TensorFlow
