## Project: Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction
Repository for submission of my capstone project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree through Udacity

This project is a recent Kaggle competition from RStudio, Google Cloud and Kaggle to demonstrate the impact that thorough data analysis can have. 
For many businesses the 80/20 rule has proven true, where only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. 
This challenges marketing teams to invest in the most appropriate promotional strategies and target the right customers to increase revenue. 
I will be employing a Deep Learning neural network here to attempt to solve the problem through TensorFlow
 
### Software and Libraries
- Python 3.6
- TensorFlow 1.9.1
- Keras 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- SHAP (https://github.com/slundberg/shap)
- eli5 (https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#installation)
- This is a processing and memory heavy problem therefore the use of Amazon Web Services was required. A virtual machine p2.xlarge instance was used, which has a storage memory of 61 GiB and a GPU memory of 12 GiB.
